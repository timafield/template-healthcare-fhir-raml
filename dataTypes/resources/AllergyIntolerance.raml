description: Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an individual and associated with exposure to a substance.
properties:
  identifier?:
    description: |
      This records identifiers associated with this allergy/intolerance concern that are defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when
      a direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written / printed documentation).
    type: Identifier[]
  clinicalStatus?:
    description: The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.
    type: code
    enum: [active, inactive, resolved]
  verificationStatus:
    description: Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk, of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).
    type: code
    enum: [unconfirmed, confirmed, refuted, entered-in-error]
  type?:
    description: Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.
    type: code
    enum: [allergy, intolerance]
  category?:
    description: Category of the identified substance.
    type: code[]
    enum: [food, medication, environment, biologic]
  criticality?:
    description: Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to the identified substance.
    type: code
    enum: [low, high, unable-to-assess]
  code?:
    description: |
      Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement). This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical
      product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., "Latex allergy"),
      or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g., "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").

      type: BackboneElement
      properties:
        substance?:
          description: |
            Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product) considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event.
            Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it.
            For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically
            safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.

          description: Record of the date and/or time of the onset of the Reaction.
          type: dateTime
        severity?:
          description: Clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction event as a whole, potentially considering multiple different manifestations.
